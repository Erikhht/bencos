#summary how to add Nero AAC encoder to BENCOS
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

By default BENCOS uses the freely avalible <a href="http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/26410.htm">3GP EnhAACPlus</a> to encode audio in AAC HE and AAC HE+PS. Quality is OK but Nero offers a better AAC encoder as a freeware, but due to it's licensing I cannot bundle it with BENCOS.

= Instructions =

To install Nero AAC:
  * Navitage to <a href="http://www.nero.com/eng/downloads-nerodigital-nero-aac-codec.php">Nero's website</a> 
  * Accept the licence and download the ZIP
  * Open the ZIP with your favorite archive manager
  * Extract "win32/neroAacEnc.exe" to BENCOS's installation folder
